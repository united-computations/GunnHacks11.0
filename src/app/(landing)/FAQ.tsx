                <Question q="What is a hackathon?">
                    Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality. Students work in teams of up to four for 24
                    hours to create something amazing. Build anything — there are no restrictions on what you can create.
                    Dive in and make the most incredible thing you can alongside fellow creators.

                <Question q="Who can attend?">
                    Any PAUSD student can attend GunnHacks. Unfortunately, we cannot allow college or out-of-district
                    students to attend this time around.
                </Question>
                <Question q="What if I don’t know how to code?">
                    All students regardless of coding ability or experience are welcome. Hackathons are a great place to
                    learn, so come and build your first app, website, or anything else! We’ll also have workshops
                    for you to start off or learn something new.
                </Question>
                <Question q="What can I build?">
                    Web, mobile, hardware, you name it — any type of project is welcome, as long as it is built within the hacking time frame.
                    Projects will be judged based on technical difficulty, practicality, creativity, and user experience by a panel of industry judges.

                {/* Update with team formation event info when that becomes available */}
                <Question q="How big should teams be?">
                    We highly encourage you to build with a team. Teamwork is deeply rooted in the hacking ethos, and
                    you’ll have a better time building with your brightest peers. Teams should consist of no more
                    than four people.
                </Question>
                <Question q="What if I don’t have a team?">
                    No problem! Many hackers do not have a fully-formed team or hack concept before the event begins. We
                    will be hosting team-forming activities before hacking begins to help you find the perfect match. If
                    you’re a first-time hacker, there will be many others looking for team members with whom you can work.
                </Question>
                <Question q="How much does it cost?">
                    Participation in GunnHacks is completely free. However, due to the{/* online */} nature of the
                    event, we recommend ownership of a computer{/* and access to the internet */}.
                </Question>
                <Question q="Do I have to work the whole time?">
                    No, not at all! We will have fun activities and workshops you can participate in when
                    you want to take a break.
